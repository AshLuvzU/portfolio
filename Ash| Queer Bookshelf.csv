"J7D3NDDP","book","2018","McNabb, Charlie","Nonbinary gender identities: history, culture, resources","","978-1-4422-7551-5","","","","""Nonbinary gender identities are those that fall outside the traditional binary of ""man"" and ""woman."" These include genderfluid, androgynous, genderqueer, and a multitude of other identity terms, some of which overlap. Although there have always been people who identify outside the gender binary, only recently have they gained popular media attention. Despite some visibility, however, nonbinary gender identities are poorly understood by the general public. It is critically important for gender minorities to find themselves in the media that they consume. Just as important is the need for those outside the minority community to understand and appreciate them. Nonbinary gender identities are represented in books and other media, but these resources prove difficult to locate, as classification vocabulary doesn't evolve as quickly as community language. Reference sources identified include archives and special collections, theses and dissertations, key journals, and related organizations and associations. This timely resource--the first reference on nonbinary gender identities--offers an accessible entry into researching this topic. Written by a nonbinary scholar and librarian, this guide includes valuable appendixes that will aid every researcher and writer: a glossary of the rich vocabulary emerging from nonbinary communities; a guide to pronoun usage; a primer on sex, sexuality, and gender; and Library of Congress Classification information.""","2018","2025-03-26 18:55:58","2025-03-26 18:55:58","","","283","","","","","Nonbinary gender identities","","","","","Rowman & Littlefield","Lanham, Maryland","","","","","","Library Catalog (Blacklight)","HQ73 .M36 2018","OCLC: 1002043873","","","https://catalog.libraries.psu.edu/catalog/22083122","","Gender identity; Gender nonconformity; Gender-nonconforming people; Genderqueer people; Geschlechtsidentität; Nonbinary gender identities; Nonfiction; Nonkonformismus; SOCIAL SCIENCE / Sociology / General; Transgender people; USA","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
