            <h1>The Crystal Egg</h1>
            <p>The first corpus I will be looking at is The Crystal Egg by H. G. Wells</p>
            <figure class="flex-container">
                <img src="pictures%20for%20website/word%20cloud%20wells.png" />

            </figure>
            <p>This word cloud features words used the most in the short story. Next to it is some
                information about what words were used the most, the word "said" being the most.</p>
            <figure class="flex-container">
                <img src="pictures%20for%20website/ugh%20KWIC.png" />

            </figure>
            <p>These next 2 images are the KWIC and the 2 word N-Gram.</p>
            <p>The KWIC was based on the word "ugh", which was used 221 times. There are 5 words on
                either side of it and it yeilded 255 hits, most of them being the name of a
                character, Ugh-lomi.</p>
            <p>The 2 letter N-Gram was also "ugh" and yeilded just 9 hits, all of them being from
                the same phrases as in the KWIC. When set to a 5 letter N-Gram, there were 239 hits,
                almost all of them being the name Ugh-lomi again.</p>

            <h1>Edgar Allen Poe Collection</h1>
            <p>The second corpus I looked at is a collection of poems by Edgar Allen Poe.</p>
            <figure class="flex-container">
                <img src="pictures%20for%20website/poe%20cloud.png" />
                <img src="pictures%20for%20website/poe%20info.png" />
            </figure>
            <p>The word cloud for this collection is made up of words that are typically used in all
                writing, such as "to" and "of".</p>
            <figure class="flex-container">
                <img src="pictures%20for%20website/and%20kwic.png" />
                <img src="pictures%20for%20website/2%20poe%20ngram.png" />
            </figure>
            <p>These next images are the KWIC and the 2 word N-Gram.</p>
            <p>The KWIC was on the word "and", which was used 12896 times. There are 5 words on
                either side and it yeilded 16290.</p>
            <p>The 2 letter N-Gram was also "and" and yeilded 4336 hits, which is a surprisingly low
                number compared to the KWIC number.</p>

            <h1>Compare and Contrast</h1>
            <p>There are not many comparisions to be made between the 2 corpuses. Poes collection is
                notably larger, and most of the results were in the tens of thousands. Wells short
                story was only in the hundreds, but had much more interesting words, like "ugh" and
                "mr".</p>
            <p>Considering the size of Poes collection I would have thought that there would be a
                much more interesting selection of wrords, but I think because of the way he writes
                the simplier words are used a lot more than any interesting word. With Wells writing
                he repeats names quite often, Ugh-lomi being mentioned a lot. He also used the word
                "ugh" as onomatopoeia a lot as well.</p>
