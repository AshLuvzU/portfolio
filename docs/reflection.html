            <p>Using GitHub and oxYgen is so much easier than WordPress, and I enjoyed it a lot
                more. The advantages of the html editor are that it's more fun to learn than
                WordPress. I know it's the same if you use the text editor rather than the visual,
                but it takes forever to load anything and it doesn't look as good as the normal
                html. Speaking of looking good, using CSS for the html page was a lot of fun and I
                enjoyed making my site unique and making a theme with it. WordPress seemed to be
                lacking in the design department, and it looks like a boring page. Depending on what
                you want on your page, you can just learn the basics of html and CSS to develop a
                good page, I, on the other hand, threw myself into JS and was making it a lot harder
                for myself, but it ended up working out for the better in the end. WordPress uses
                the same html and CSS knowledge and can be used without any of that as well, but the
                result isn't as good as it can be. </p>
