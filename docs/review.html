            <h1>The Things We Lost In The Flood</h1>
            <p> The Things We Lost In The Flood was made by Awkward Silence Games, developed by Dean
                Moynihan, and music by Leafcuts.</p>
            <div class="flex-container">

            </div>
            <p>The premise of the games seems to be to just cross the water that has covered the
                earth while collecting bottles with messages, floppy disks, and new parts for your
                boat. The game starts you off on a remote island where the main character has to
                drag a boat full of holes to the water. From there you just keep paddling across the
                new ocean that has formed, occasionally there will be a bottle or a boat part that
                floats by. Towards the middle of the journey there is a door with a number on it, I
                didn't have enough of the disks to open it, but there is probably a secrete behind
                it.</p>

            </div>
            <p>The story behind this games seems to deal with some heavy topics such as grief and
                loss in general. The games has you write down topic such as "write something
                personal" and "describe someone you love", then tells you to throw the bottle into
                the ocean.</p>

            <h1>Kumu Network</h1>
            <p>This Kumu network shows the connection between the item and the role it has within
                the game. I wish there was more to go off of, but this game contains no dialouge and
                other characters for the player to interact with.</p>
